## 「Stochastic」与「Random」有何区别？
统计角度上讲，都是随机，但是：

random的几率是相同的，比如说扔骰子，怎么扔都是6分之1；然而stochastic的每次几率是可以不同的，比如说今天有50%的可能性下雨（气压、湿度各种影响），明天有77.7%的可能性下雨。

所以随机过程叫stochastic process。

>With random process, the same probability is assigned to all outcomes because each outcome has an equal chance of occurring. Typical examples of random processes include drawing a card from a deck, rolling a die, or tossing a coin. In a geographic context, an ornithologist might develop a GIS model to predict breeding bird occupancy within a wildlife refuge by assigning all nesting locations an equal random probability for occupancy.With stochastic process, the likelihood or probability of any particular outcome can be specified and not all outcomes are equally likely of occurring. For example, an ornithologist may assign a greater probability that a bird will select a nesting location based on how far it is from the edge of the refuge or whether the location is shielded by a dense tree canopy.
